| Experiment | Accuracy | Confusion Matrix | Comment |
|--------------|----------|------------------|---------|
| Solution 1   | 0.8051948051948052  | [[143 16]  [29 43]] | Added more features to 'glucose' and 'bmi', that being 'bp' and 'insulin'. Additional adjustment made was adjusting the size of the test data to 30 percent, which seemed to help increase the accuracy. Also adjusted the hyperparameters for LogisticRegression, changing max_iter to '500'. However, the max iteration adjustment didn't seem to play much of a role at all - Refer to lab3_version1.py for code |
| Solution 2   | 0.7864583333333334  | [[116 14]  [27 35]] | With 'glucose' seeming to play a role in increasing the accuracy, another adjustment made was adding 'bmi' as a feature along with 'glucose'. Also, adjusted the random_state parameter of train_test_split to '30' as that seemed to help increse the accuracy - Refer to lab3_version2.py for code |
| Solution 3   | 0.7083333333333334 | [[102  21] [35  34]] | Used only 'glucose' feature and adjusted train_test_split parameter by changing random_state to "42" - Refer to lab3_version3.py for code |
| Baseline     | 0.6770833333333334 | [[114  16] [46  16]] | NA - Baseline Solution |
